APC GUI Quick install quide

1. Untar the tarball into a directory in your webspace.

2. If you have additional servers, you may add them to the config.php file
   Refer to the comments in config.php for more info.
   Otherwise, never mind.. APC-GUI will work out of the box.

3. Don't forget to protect your APC-GUI Directory with .htaccess or something

4. Make sure you have the all-newest APC version running.. or some 
   GUI-Functions will not work, and you'll get some ugly error messages.

5. Ah, yes, and your PHP will need GD Support.. 


That was quick, wasn't it? :-)
